# OpenCtrl

OpenCtrl is an open-source playground for building custom user interfaces and control surfaces which are fast to prototype, easy to extend, and friendly to tinkerers. The goal is a small ecosystem of reusable modules and examples that help you go from idea to working input in minutes. 

Contributions, experiments, and new cores/modules are welcome.
